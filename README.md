# Design-and-Verfication-of-APB-AHB-Bridge
This repository contains the RTL design and verification of an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) to AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) bridge. The APB to AHB bridge facilitates communication between low-speed peripheral devices and high-speed system components in an ARM-based SoC (System on Chip).
